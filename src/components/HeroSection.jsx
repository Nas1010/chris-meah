                  Hi, I'm Chris! I completed my PhD and MSc at the University of Birmingham, where I also graduated top of my class with a BSc in AI and Computer Science. I'm passionate about building innovative AI solutions, training others to understand and leverage AI's potential, and speaking about its impact on our future.
        
                  With a solid foundation in AI research and development, I love sharing my knowledge and helping others unlock the power of AI for practical and creative applications. Whether through hands-on projects or insightful discussions, Iâ€™m excited to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
